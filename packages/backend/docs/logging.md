Here's how this repo handles logging

Compass backend logging: `winston`

- the general purpose logger for production & development

HTTP Middleware: `express-winson`

- for production & development

Fancy console.logs: `debug`

- debug is like an augmented version of console.log, but unlike console.log, you donâ€™t have to comment out debug logs in production code. Logging is turned off by default and can be conditionally turned on by using the DEBUG environment variable.
